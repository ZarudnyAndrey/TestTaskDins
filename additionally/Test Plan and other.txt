4. Errors in project occur when trying to delete some entities from database.
For example: When deleting any of two initial users, we get an error from server related to a restriction on this operation. [pic1 and pic2]
When we try to delete second contact of first user, we discover his absence, although calling all contacts shows opposite. [pic3 and pic4]
